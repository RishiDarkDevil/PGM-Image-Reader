# PGM-Image-Reader
This is a program to read images of the type P5 with .pgm extension, i.e. portable gray map. It stores the pixel values as a matrix, to allow easy manipulation and image processing. To use this code you should compile(g++) and run it in the same folder as the image files. It generates the output image as "out-&lt;filename>" in the same directory. You can include it as a header file in your other programs, to make the input and output of the image files easier.
